===============================

This was a fun little porject I completed after watching Udacity's course on [Object Oriented Javascript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015).

You can play by simply downloading the repo and opening `index.html` in your browser.

If I feel like it, I may add the ability to collect gems, change players, and calculate scoring, but for now, on to bigger and better things. Enjoy!
